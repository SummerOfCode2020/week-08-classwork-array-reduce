    We will push to github all along the way so we track our week and keep a log

    Fork
    Clone to local machine
    First step on local: `git checkout -b answer`

    Declaring an Array with Objects
    and
    Referencing code in other files

    1)  Please read all instructions first!

        Create a new file named "grades.js" to import in the data folder
        
        Declare and initialize an array named `grades`
    
        Include at least 5 object items in the array 
        
        Each object will have properties of
            - `assignmentName`  with string values such as "Assignment 01"
            - `studentName` with string values such as "Tito"
            - `score` with numeric values such as 50

        Values are important for this lesson.

            - Use 2 distinct assignment names
            - Use 2 distinct student names
